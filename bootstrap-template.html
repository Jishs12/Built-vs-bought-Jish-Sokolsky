      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35 in Super Bowl LVII this past February to capture their 2nd title in 5 years. While there is no doubt that the efforts of the players and coaches should be the focus, there is a hidden art that goes into building a championship caliber roster. Every general manager has a different philosophy, but very few will win a title, let alone multiple. Despite the variety and nuance, these philosophies usually lean one of two ways: do we build through the draft and develop young talent, or do we mortgage our future assets to acquire superstar players through trades and free agency? To put it in simpler terms: should we build or buy our team? In reality, there is plenty of nuance that goes into building a bona fide champion that can compete for years.</p>
        <p>
        When examining the Chiefs roster, at first glance it appears that Kansas City follows the latter strategy. The data shows that more than half of the team was not drafted to the Super Bowl champs after all. That is correct, but it is worth noting exactly which pieces were built versus bought.  </p>
        <p> MVP quarterback Patrick Mahomes (pictured above), All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce and pro bowl defensive tackle Chris Jones were all pieces the Chiefs drafted and developed. Many would argue that these three guys make up the core of this team. The other players around them that came in externally, such as wide receiver Juju Smith-Schuster, tackle Orlando Brown and safety Justin Reid were less stars and more role players on the squad.  </p>

        <p>The prevailing strategy for 2023 is to have a strong base of drafted players, while spending on role players here and there. But one does not have to look far to see a more extreme spending strategy pay off. Just a year prior, the Rams won the super bowl with just over 40% of their team coming from the draft. </p>

       </div>
       
       <div class="col-sm-5">
        <p> Pieces like corner Jalen Ramsey (pictured left) and quarterback Matthew Stafford were all acquired by the Rams trading multiple first round picks. On top of that, big contributors such as tackle <a href="https://www.osdbsports.com/nfl/players/andrew-whitworth/contracts/f1ce3e7d-6afc-4db4-94f0-475bd63507b3">Andrew Whitworth</a> and wide receiver <a href="https://www.osdbsports.com/nfl/players/robert-woods/618bedee-9259-4536-b0ff-fec98d2a20de">Robert Woods</a> were acquired in free agency for big money.</p>
        <p>Despite not having a first round pick in the draft since 2016, the Rams won the big game. But in the 2022 season, the Rams finished 5-12 which was last in the NFC West. This raises the question of whether or not this type of aggressive spending is sustainable, and if it isn’t, is it worth it? </p>
        <p>Rich Hammond, a former beat reporter for the LA Rams and current co-host of The Athletic’s “11 personnel” podcast about the Rams, argues that the strategy is not the issue. According to Hammond, trading away premiere draft capital is just another way of using it. In the Rams case, they used it to bring in bona fide stars to lead their team to a championship now rather than play the long game.</p>
        <p> “People are missing they did not just give away those picks” Hammond explains, “[Stafford and Ramsey were] a sure bet for us instead of two first round picks that may not turn out to be something.” </p>
        <p>In Hammond’s eyes, the draft’s later rounds are where teams “build depth and replenish”, especially for the Rams. In 2017 and 2018, Los Angeles acquired key depth pieces such as safety John Johnson, defensive tackle Greg Gains and the super bowl MVP Cooper Kupp. Hammond believes a key reason for the Rams fall off has been their questionable drafting decisions with the limited capital they have had in recent years:</p>

        <p>“Look at the last 2-3 years of drafts, they aren’t getting that same jump. That’s where not having a first round pick hurts” says Hammond, “If they hit, this is an entirely different conversation we are having.”</p>
        <p>Hammond admits that the strategy is risky, and as the 2022 Rams demonstrated, the fall off can be catastrophic. As soon as a few bad decisions begin to pile up, an implosion is imminent. Despite this, Hammond is of the opinion that the championship makes it worth it. “It was different, it was very very high risk and there is a reason not every team does it…It was worth [even though it] may not be sustainable for 20 years.” </p>
        <p>However, the strategy can work as long as teams make the right decisions. “The Rams navigated that for years…sometimes it doesn’t work out very well. [That] doesn’t necessarily mean the strategy is wrong” Hammond explains, “[The Rams] took a lot of big swings…eventually you’re gonna miss.”</p>
        <p>So far, the Chiefs have hit on those swings. While the majority of the team was not drafted by Kansas City, the Chiefs have made smart decisions in the draft to build the foundation for their team. Whether or not a fall off on the level of the Rams is in store remains to be determined, but for now, the Chiefs have laid the latest blueprint to build a championship winning roster.</p>
